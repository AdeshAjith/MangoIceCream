Make a mango puree: dice the pulp of your mango, taking care to remove the skin, and add it to the blender. Taste the pulp, add sugar accordingly, and blend until it is smooth without adding any water.

Add the cream to a mixing bowl. Whip the cream using a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, until soft peaks form.

Add the mango puree to the whipped cream and mix for 1-2 minutes until they are well combined. Taste it and add white sugar if itâ€™s needed.

Pour the combined mango and cream mixture into a freezer-friendly container with a lid. Close the lid tightly. Freeze the ice cream for 5-6 hours, or until it is set.

Take the mango ice cream out of the freezer and let it thaw for 5 minutes to let it soften a little before eating.
